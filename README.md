# 🏛 Fz3r0 - Enterprise IT Frameworks

> A structured knowledge base dedicated to understanding how enterprise Information Technology (IT) organizations are governed, designed, and operated. <br> Including: service management frameworks, standards, and process engineering documentation (ISO, ITIL, ITSM, COBIT, NIST)

## 📌 Disclaimer

This repository is educational and framework-based in nature.
It does not represent any specific organization or internal documentation.

## 🌍 What Are Enterprise IT Frameworks?

Enterprise IT frameworks are structured bodies of knowledge that define how large-scale Information Technology (IT) environments are governed, managed, secured, and continuously improved.

They provide:

* 📐 Standardized practices
* 🏛 Governance models
* 🔄 Operational processes
* 📊 Risk control mechanisms
* 🛡 Compliance guidelines
* 🚀 Continuous improvement methodologies

These frameworks help organizations align technology with business objectives, reduce operational risk, maintain regulatory compliance, and ensure service reliability at scale.

- They are not tools.
- They are not software platforms.
- They are structured methodologies that guide how IT should function within an enterprise.

## 📚 Scope

This repository covers major enterprise Information Technology domains, including:

* 🏛 **IT Governance** - Structures and principles that define how Information Technology (IT) is directed and controlled within an organization.
* 🔄 **IT Service Management (ITSM)** - The discipline of designing, delivering, managing, and improving Information Technology (IT) services.
* 📘 **Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL)** - A widely adopted framework that provides best practices for IT Service Management (ITSM).
* 📏 **International Organization for Standardization (ISO) standards** - Formal, certifiable standards such as ISO 20000 (IT Service Management), ISO 27001 (Information Security Management), and ISO 9001 (Quality Management).
* 🏛 **Control Objectives for Information and Related Technologies (COBIT)** - A governance framework for enterprise Information Technology (IT) management and control.
* 🛡 **National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) frameworks** - Security and risk management guidance models widely adopted across industries.
* 📊 Risk and Compliance models - Frameworks that address operational risk, regulatory requirements, and internal controls.
* 🧩 Process Engineering - The structured design and optimization of operational processes such as Incident Management, Change Management, and Problem Management.

## 🚀 Long-Term Vision

To build a comprehensive reference that connects:

Business Strategy → Governance → Frameworks → Processes → Operational Execution

Designed for engineers, architects, and IT leaders who want to understand not only how systems operate, but how enterprise Information Technology (IT) organizations are structured, controlled, and continuously improved.
