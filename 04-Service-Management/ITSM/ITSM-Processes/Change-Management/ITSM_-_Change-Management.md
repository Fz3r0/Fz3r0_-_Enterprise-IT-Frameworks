# 🛠 IT Service Managemet (ITSM): `Change Management`

> A structured approach to controlling modifications in enterprise Information Technology (IT) environments in order to reduce risk and increase service reliability.

## 📘 Introduction

Change Management is a core process within **IT Service Management (ITSM)**.

In enterprise Information Technology (IT) environments, change is constant. Infrastructure evolves, applications are updated, configurations are modified, and services are improved.

However, **uncontrolled changes are one of the primary causes of service disruption.**

Change Management exists to ensure that changes are:

* 📋 Properly documented
* 🔍 Risk-assessed
* ✅ Authorized before implementation
* 📅 Scheduled in a controlled manner
* 🔄 Reviewed after execution

When structured correctly, Change Management reduces incidents and increases operational stability.

## 🧩 What Is a Change?

A **Change** is:

- **The addition, modification, or removal of any authorized, planned, or supported service or service component that may affect Information Technology (IT) services.**

_If it can impact availability, performance, security, or reliability, it qualifies as a change._

## 🎯 What Is Change Management?

**Change Management** is the practice of maximizing the number of successful service and product changes by:

- 🔍 Ensuring risks are properly assessed
- ✅ Authorizing changes before implementation
- 📅 Managing change schedules
- 🤝 Coordinating resources
- ⚠️ Reducing unintended service disruption

_The objective is not to prevent change, it is to enable change safely._

## 🖥 Practical Examples of Changes

Changes vary in urgency and impact. Examples include:

- 🟢 **Standard Change** :: (Pre-authorized, low-risk, repeatable, and does not require approval each time it is executed) : e.g.: Adding a pre-approved Virtual Local Area Network (VLAN) tag to an access interface using a documented procedure 
- 🚦 **Normal Change** :: (Requires risk assessment and formal approval; may be low, medium, or high impact and is not pre-approved) : e.g.: Creating a new VLAN with a Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) and deploying it across multiple switches.
- ⚠️ **Emergency Change** :: (Implemented urgently to resolve a major incident or prevent significant business impact) : e.g.: Reverting a faulty routing configuration to restore service during a production outage.
- ⏱️ **Expedited Change** :: (time-sensitive but not necessarily tied to an active outage; follows an accelerated review process) : e.g.: Deploying a security patch within a shortened approval window due to a vulnerability alert.

The complexity of the task does not define whether it is a change. The potential impact does.

## 🔍 Why Change Management Matters

Uncontrolled changes increase:

* ⚠️ Service outages
* 📉 Business disruption
* 🛡 Security vulnerabilities
* 📊 Compliance risk

Structured Change Management enables:

* 📐 Defined processes
* 🏛 Governance and oversight
* 🤖 Approval workflows
* 👁 Process visibility
* 📊 Reduced incident rates

## 💡 Important

- **Planned and properly controlled changes reduce the number of incidents.**

_Change Management transforms reactive operations into controlled evolution._
